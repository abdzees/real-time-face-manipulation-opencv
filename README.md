# Real-Time Face Manipulation with OpenCV

This project is a real-time face manipulation application that uses OpenCV to track facial keypoints and apply dynamic filters. By leveraging an existing facial landmark detection model, the system identifies key skeletal points on the face and overlays graphical effects in real time. This provides a fun and interactive way to explore computer vision, facial recognition, and live image processing.

## Features

- Real-time webcam feed with facial keypoint detection
- Multiple face manipulation filters
- Interactive key bindings for easy control

## Usage

To get started, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, then run the application using:

```bash
python run.py
```

- Press ? to cycle through available filters

- Press q to exit the application
